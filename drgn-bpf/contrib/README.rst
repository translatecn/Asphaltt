Community-Contributed Content
=============================

This directory contains drgn scripts, libraries, and notes that have been
contributed by the community but aren't considered a part of drgn proper. Code
in this directory is not tested and not necessarily up to the rest of the
project's standards.

This is intended as a central location to share drgn ideas with a low barrier
to entry. If you have time to polish your code, consider submitting it as a
proper helper or tool. If not, feel free to dump it here. Someone else might
find it useful as a starting point for their own investigation. It could even
be adapted into a helper or tool later.

Contributing to ``contrib``
---------------------------

The bar for contributing to ``contrib`` is intentionally low. Code submitted
here can be rough and will be only lightly reviewed. The only hard requirements
are:

* It must be relevant to drgn.
* All files must have a comment or docstring at the top describing what they
  are. This can be short.

There are also some boring legal requirements:

* All files must have a copyright notice.
* All files must be licensed under the LGPLv2.1+ (using
  ``SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-2.1-or-later``).
* All commits must have a ``Signed-off-by`` trailer. See `Signing Off
  <../CONTRIBUTING.rst#signing-off>`_.

We may choose to edit, reorganize, or drop parts your contribution. If in
doubt, go ahead and open a pull request, and we'll decide what to do with it.
